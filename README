The basic idea of this project is trying a combination of Apache Camel as part of a
BPEL-Orchestrated Process.

At first this is a primitive example of using CXF as Camel-Endpoint with multiversion-support.

This is a Eclipse & Maven project, created from an Apache Camel-Spring maven archetype Version 2.7. (or so)

Build:
mvn clean install

Run:
mvn camel:run

This starts a jetty-server and publishes a SOAP-Webservice.
Locate the wsdl at 

	http://localhost:9000/order?wsdl
	
I recommend using SOAP-UI for trying it out. 
(Well you could use Camel, but this is kinda boring (client code is too similar to the provider-code) 
in that case. ;-))

Right now there are two operations as Version 1 and Version 2 - Other Examples will follow
